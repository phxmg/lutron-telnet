# Project Cleanup and Restructuring

This document summarizes the cleanup and restructuring changes made to the Lutron Telnet Controller project.

## Directory Structure Changes

The codebase has been reorganized into a proper directory structure:

```

├── docs/                  # Documentation
│   ├── CHANGES.md         # This document
│   └── LUTRON_GUIDE.md    # Lutron protocol documentation
├── scripts/               # Individual command scripts
│   ├── bedroom_lights.py
│   ├── kitchen_all.py

├── .gitignore             # Git ignore patterns
├── lutron                 # Simple shell wrapper for CLI
├── lutron_cli.py          # Main unified CLI
├── README.md              # Project documentation
└── setup.py               # Package installation
```

## Consolidated Functionality

All functionality is now available through the unified CLI (`lutron_cli.py`), which provides a clean, consistent interface for:

1. Controlling individual zones
2. Controlling rooms (multiple zones at once)
3. Running light shows
4. Monitoring bridge activity
5. Listing available zones

## Eliminated Duplicate Code

The following improvements were made to eliminate duplicate code:

1. Consolidated all command-line utilities into a single CLI
2. Centralized zone definitions in `src/lutron_zones.py`
3. Created a proper controller hierarchy with layered abstractions
4. Made scripts in the `scripts/` directory import from the core library

## Removed Files

The following files were removed as they were redundant or superseded by improved versions:

- lutron_client.py
- debug.py 
- help_debug.py
- caseta_debug.py
- connection_test.py
- caseta_commands.py
- simple_monitor.py
- lutron_telnet.py
- control_example.py
- lutron_simple.py
- lutron_quick.py (moved to src/)
- LUTRON_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md (replaced by LUTRON_GUIDE.md)
- examples/master_bedroom_lights.py

## Installation Improvements

The project is now installable as a Python package with:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage Changes

Instead of using multiple different scripts, the recommended way to use the library is now through the unified CLI:

```bash
# Use the wrapper script (easier)
./lutron room kitchen on

# Or the full Python script
./lutron_cli.py room kitchen on
```

## Other Improvements

1. Added a proper setup.py file for installation
2. Enhanced the README with detailed usage examples
3. Created a shell script wrapper for easier access
4. Added proper documentation in the docs directory
5. Updated the .gitignore file with standard patterns
